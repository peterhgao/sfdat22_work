**Project Idea:** What are the predictors of getting hired as a data scientist?

**Binary Response Variable:**
* 1 if hired as data scientist (based on LI profile)
* 0 if applied or expressed interest in data scientist role but was not hired (based on LI profile)

**Background**: I can leverage LinkedIn data for this project. There are many model features I can incorporate and I think a big component of this project would be building the base dataset in Pig and cleaning it in Python. Another challenge is finding a representative sample of negative responses (those not hired as data scientists), since I wouldn't want to just model off of the positive response (hired as data scientist). I chose this topic because I am interested in this data science career path and think many in the class or in general can benefit from this research as well.

**Data available that I can use as predictor variables / model features:**
* Top profile skills
* Degree of Education (Masters, Bachelors, PhD)
* Degree concentration / majors
* Data bootcamp enrollment
* Online Data Science Courses (Coursera, Lynda)
* School graduated from
* Previous employers
* Previously held positions
* Company that hired data scientist
* Location or Region
* Industry
* Companies or news channels followed
* Content engagement
* Profile keywords (data science, python, etc.)
